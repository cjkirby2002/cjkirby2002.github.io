<H1>Hi, I'm Claudia (she/her)</H1>
<h2>I am a junior at the University of Colorado Boulder</h2>
<p>Here, I am studying advertising with minors in communications, business, and creative technology and design.</h2> 
   I am from the suburbs of Chicago and grew up coming to Boulder, so I am so excited to be here. <br>
    <br>
    Over the summer, I redesigned a website for the company I interned at, with a lot of help from Google. I went in having no previous web experience, but learned a lot along the way. I am excited to actually understand what I have been doing all summer on
    a deeper level as well as answer all of the questions I had while working.</p>
